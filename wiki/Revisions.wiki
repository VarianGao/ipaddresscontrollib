#summary A list of changes for each released revision

=== Revision 37 (27-Jun-08) ===

  * Changed base of `IPAddressControl` to `ContainerControl` so that it's `AutoScaleMode` could be set to `AutoScaleMode.Dpi`.  Also set the `FixedWidth` and `FixedHeight` control styles to true.  These changes fix rendering problems when screen resolution is 120 dpi.
  * Using `Graphics.DrawString()` rather than `TextRenderer.DrawText()` in `DotControl`.  `TextRenderer` does not use the correct baseline at 120 dpi.
  * Rearranged some `enum` and `EventArgs` so that each control class is the first class in its file.


=== Revision 36 (27-Apr-08) ===

  * Added propagation of `KeyDown`, `KeyUp`, and `PreviewKeyDown` events. `Keys.Enter` and `Keys.Return` will now propagate a `KeyPress` event.


=== Revision 29 (16-Dec-07) ===

  * Added a Visual Studio 2008 project.  The VS 2005 and VS 2008 projects have the same source code.  Some minor changes were made to remove code analysis warnings.


=== Revision 26 (23-Oct-07) ===

  * Fixed an issue with `ReadOnly` controls still being editable.


=== Revision 22 (27-Sep-07) ===

  * Added event propagation for focus, key press, and some mouse events.
  * Added `AllowInternalTab` and `AnyBlank` properties.
  * Removed superfluous code.
  * Removed a potential resource leak when calculating text size and added a `null` check for `SetAddressBytes()`.
  * Compliant with !FxCop 1.35.


=== Revision 15 (2-Jul-07) ===

  * Text set in design mode is persisted.
  * Removed override of `AutoSize`.  Use `AutoHeight` instead.
  * <VS05> Modified size calculations to conserve horizontal space.
